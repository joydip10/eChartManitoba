# 📖 eChartManitoba

A decentralized, patient-centered **Electronic Health Record (EHR)** system designed for **Manitoba, Canada**, built on **Ethereum blockchain technology** and **smart contracts**, aligned with the **Personal Health Information Act (PHIA)**.

This project addresses the limitations of Manitoba’s current centralized **eChart Manitoba** system by introducing a secure, privacy-focused, and patient-controlled healthcare data infrastructure.
